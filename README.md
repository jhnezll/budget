# 💸 Welcome to Budget!

Budget allows users to keep track of how many calories they are intaking while at the same time budgeting how much they are spending. 
**It is built with people who want to lose weight but cannot afford more expensive ingredients in mind.** When the user goes to the 
store to prepare dinner, they don’t have to stress about overspending too much. Simply by adding an item, Budget will grab information 
from the database and show the user how many calories each item is. Input the price, and Budget will keep track of the both the 
calories and total (with tax).
